* DeletionForm doesn't yet support restoration. Restore just restores the subject and ignores all dependencies.

* Cancel text-complete popup on blur.

* Would by nice to redo the .validation package but can also live with it for now.
  * It doesn't need the middle I type. (?)
  * The [CV]Part{,U} relatioships are poor. Redesign and simplify.
  * looseMsg & per-field error reporting to shit. Ignore it and *IF* it's necessary
    somewhere to have multiple fields + looseMsg, make that an addon construct.
  * Failure needs to turn into VDOM nicely (not just .toGenericText with CRs in it).
